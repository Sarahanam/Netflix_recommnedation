# Netflix_recommnedation
üé¨ Netflix-Style Movie Recommendation System is a full-stack machine learning project that provides movie recommendations based on user input, inspired by the Netflix interface. It uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm trained on a cleaned version of the MovieLens or Netflix dataset (movies_metadata_processed.csv). The backend is built using Flask, while the frontend uses HTML/CSS and displays movie posters in a visually engaging Netflix-like style. The project structure includes an app/ folder with templates/ for HTML, static/ for CSS, and the main app.py for routing and logic. A models/ directory stores the serialized KNN model (knn_model.pkl), and a data/ directory holds the preprocessed dataset. To run the project, create a virtual environment, install dependencies from requirements.txt, and launch the app using python app/app.py, then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser. Features include movie similarity search, scalable ML architecture, and a visually rich UI. Planned improvements include login support, collaborative filtering, trailer integration, and deployment. The project is ideal for demonstrating practical ML and web integration skills. üë©‚Äçüíª Developed by Sarah Anam and Zainab Zaara.
